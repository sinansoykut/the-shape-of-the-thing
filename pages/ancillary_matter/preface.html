            so what, why, and wherefore<br>
            poems written to restore<br>
            these were set down to elucidate<br>
            the cage around we see as fate<br>
            <br>
            to explain to you<br>
            what's plain to me<br>
            to take my truths<br>
            and set them free<br>
            <br>
            that we create our gods as culture<br>
            and understand them as immutable<br>
            that while we worship, they endure<br>
            but in our remaking they're refutable<br>
            <br>
            it's purpose is a heresy<br>
            of our corrupted pantheon<br>
            that we remake with clarity<br>
            and usher here a bright new dawn<br>
            <br>
            this was written for those who can read<br>
            for those with hearts that weep and bleed<br>
            bound together with silver string<br>
            this was written for all who sing
