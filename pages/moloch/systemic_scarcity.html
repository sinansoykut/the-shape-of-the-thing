         <p>
            this is the place where people freeze<br>
            and children hunger with unmet pleas<br>
            the baseline is to be without<br>
            to be uneasy and feel doubt<br>
            <br>
            resources are scarce this you will know<br>
            because our law and lobbies make them so<br>
            privatized and deregulated<br>
            access for some while the rest are unsated<br>
            <br>
            "well unemployment is good actually<br>
            to keep the poors from their laxity"<br>
            <br>
            is housing a human need?<br>
            or is it a tool for human greed?<br>
            as long as a house is an asset class<br>
            people will live under the overpass<br>
            <br>
            money is used to speculate<br>
            to control the supply and increase the rate<br>
            <br>
            it's hard to see others with your head under water<br>
            it's hard to care when you hear of the slaughter<br>
            our power is broken, and we're disconnected<br>
            our nose to the grindstone, keeps us subjected<br>
            <br>
            this has been the way of things<br>
            for as long as we been writing<br>
            that wealth accrues from scarcity<br>
            by keeping us infighting<br>
            <br>
            well scarcity's made by middlemen<br>
            who scoop up our goods, to sell back again<br>
            so let's change the rules, and fix our plight<br>
            access for all is what's ours by right<br>
