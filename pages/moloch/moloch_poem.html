         <p>
            our god who whispers and divides bears the name moloch<br>
            and his offered purpose is to despoil human stock<br>
            moloch the god of competition, ruin, and sacrifice<br>
            asks "what's the least you'd take, for your own bride price?"<br>
            <br>
            moloch is the official, who oversees the race<br>
            the prison guard proffering preferential place<br>
            <br>
            selling us a story, with zero summation<br>
            we compete with each other, to raise our own station<br>
            <br>
            that scarcity is carved into social stone<br>
            "fight" says moloch, "or starve alone"<br>
            the law of the jungle is eat or be ate<br>
            it's natural and good, if you want to be great<br>
            <br>
            so in our squabbling, scrambling, sordid fight<br>
            we've no one to turn to, to make things right<br>
            what once was whole, we have forsaken<br>
            the thing that was shared, we no longer partake in<br>
            <br>
            we line ourselves up, in order of power descending<br>
            to kneel at the altar of he who's pretending<br>
            some must rise, and some must fall<br>
            for moloch to fly, we must crawl<br>
            <br>
            our great dilemma<br>
            is to share or to hoard<br>
            but it's hard to be generous<br>
            when all you know is the sword<br>
            <br>
            he endlessly hungers, and cannot be sated<br>
            moloch shops around what you have donated<br>
            in a race to the bottom, of what we hold dear<br>
            everything is demanded, and we pay it in fear<br>
            <br>
            power concedes nothing, without demand<br>
            moloch will not free us, 'til we force his hand<br>
