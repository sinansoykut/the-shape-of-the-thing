         <p>
            power power everywhere<br>
            from halls to dripping ink<br>
            from top to bottom, power flows<br>
            this is how we think<br>
            <br>
            human hierarchy is a special kind of scheme<br>
            inescapably ubiquitous is how the thing would seem<br>
            when creating structure, we ask who will be at the top?<br>
            and working down from there, we ask who is it we can drop?<br>
            <br>
            in a place as this<br>
            where positions rise and fall<br>
            our ambitions are to climb ahead<br>
            and behind us leave a wall<br>
            <br>
            the constant scramble, leads to the notion<br>
            that our status here, is of our own motion<br>
            "you get what you grab, and if you're too slow<br>
            you'll always be poor, you'll always be low"<br>
            <br>
            who can turn their back on this?<br>
            sense is to climb the ladder<br>
            it is only being spurned<br>
            by those who're getting madder<br>
            <br>
            hierarchies are a tool<br>
            something like a contest played<br>
            everyone competes<br>
            but it's only winners getting paid<br>
            <br>
            with the understanding of a sentient org chart<br>
            the path that's presupposed is the one without a heart<br>
            when pyramids are all you know, they're what you will create<br>
            not to say they're good and right, but are how we relate<br>
            <br>
            as above, so below<br>
            we are bound in this thing together<br>
            those who fly, and those who fall<br>
            all birds of a feather<br>
