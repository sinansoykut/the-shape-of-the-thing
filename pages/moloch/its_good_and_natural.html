         <p>
            "it's good and natural, this thing that we have built<br>
            and as you step on others, you should feel no guilt<br>
            for those who're getting trampled, it may seem unfair<br>
            but everyone is trampling here, it's not for you to care"<br>
            <br>
            ours is a hierarchy of power<br>
            and insecurity of place<br>
            either you'll ascend the tower<br>
            or fail to keep the pace<br>
            <br>
            this is how it's always been<br>
            the fittest will survive<br>
            "it's not through cooperation<br>
            but through strength that you may thrive"<br>
            <br>
            the robber barons keep on telling<br>
            it's inevitable and just<br>
            yet all the while they're selling<br>
            us a deeply sown distrust<br>
            <br>
            we make our jungle laws, to eat each other up<br>
            justifications made to drink down another's cup<br>
            <br>
            in our alleged meritocracy<br>
            we get exactly what we're owed<br>
            but the landed aristocracy<br>
            sit back and reap what we have sowed<br>
            <br>
            so as you struggle to survive in this system of ours<br>
            what doesn't kill you, leaves you covered in scars<br>
            it ain't natural or good, for us to compete<br>
            we were made for each other, to share what's replete<br>
