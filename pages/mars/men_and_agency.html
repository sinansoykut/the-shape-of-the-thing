            sexual assault<br>
            is a pervasive problem here<br>
            with mental somersaults<br>
            we ask was the clothing sheer?<br>
            <br>
            "I couldn't help myself<br>
            did you see how she was dressed?<br>
            if women leave the house like that<br>
            they deserve the rest"<br>
            <br>
            men are not simple automata<br>
            operating by instinct<br>
            we have agency to act and choose<br>
            what we think and do are linked<br>
            <br>
            a rapist rapes because<br>
            they do not see another person<br>
            not because of hormones<br>
            but because of their perversion<br>
            <br>
            casting men as predators<br>
            slavering over prey<br>
            sets tone for what's acceptable<br>
            and leads us to downplay<br>
            <br>
            if we excuse the acts of men<br>
            as biologically compelled<br>
            we teach women that from us<br>
            trust must be withheld<br>
            <br>
            under such a system<br>
            it cannot be asked<br>
            "why are women so choosy<br>
            why are men typecast?"<br>
            <br>
            to be a male victim<br>
            within a place as this<br>
            is to be party to<br>
            the women we dismiss<br>
            <br>
            our worship of power<br>
            paints victims as faulted<br>
            but it's shameful to assault<br>
            not to be assaulted<br>
            <br>
            men are human people<br>
            with normal human volition<br>
            if we are denied this<br>
            we'll behave without contrition<br>
            <br>
            we're regular people<br>
            we do as we decide<br>
            in your autonomy<br>
            please have some pride<br>
         </p>
