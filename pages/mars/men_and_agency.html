sexual assault
is a pervasive problem here
with mental somersaults
we ask was the clothing sheer?

"I couldn't help myself
did you see how she was dressed?
if women leave the house like that
they deserve the rest"

men are not simple automata
operating by instinct
we have agency to act and choose
what we think and do are linked

a rapist rapes because
they do not see another person
not because of hormones
but because of their perversion

casting men as predators
slavering over prey
sets tone for what's acceptable
and leads us to downplay

if we excuse the acts of men
as biologically compelled
we teach women that from us
trust must be withheld

under such a system
it cannot be asked
"why are women so choosy
why are men typecast?"

to be a male victim
within a place as this
is to be party to
the women we dismiss

our worship of power
paints victims as faulted
but it's shameful to assault
not to be assaulted

men are human people
with normal human volition
if we are denied this
we'll behave without contrition

we're regular people
we do as we decide
in your autonomy
please have some pride
