         <p>
            if the realm of men you'll claim<br>
            then your obliged to play the game<br>
            <br>
            teasing, joking, jostling, fights<br>
            climbing the ranks in endless rites<br>
            raise yourself, above your peers<br>
            compare wealth and your careers<br>
            <br>
            all the men play, no one's exempt<br>
            no time outs granted, no safe attempt<br>
            it starts with your peers or begins with your dad<br>
            it ends when you die, no escape to be had<br>
            <br>
            no girls allowed, this is for the boys<br>
            our game of status, and endless poise<br>
            played against men, and judged by them too<br>
            respect is the prize which we try to accrue<br>
            <br>
            it's won and lost in ten thousand ways<br>
            in every action, in all your displays<br>
            <br>
            how well do you perform the role?<br>
            how well do you police it?<br>
            dominance here is the goal<br>
            to be meek makes you unfit<br>
            <br>
            what happens to players who never can rest<br>
            tiptoeing around an unending test?<br>
            to always be guarded, to never relent<br>
            to seek someone smaller whom you can torment<br>
            <br>
            comply and conform, or you will be shamed<br>
            there can be no trust among those who are maimed<br>
            without a safe place, to let down your guard<br>
            you walk 'round the world, feathered and tarred<br>
            <br>
            this is the game we're compelled to play<br>
            how we make manhood, and how we betray<br>
