         <p>
            the bespoke god of man we've made<br>
            goes by the name of mars<br>
            and his consuming hunger<br>
            demands offerings of ours<br>
            <br>
            mars the god of man<br>
            of virility and war<br>
            mars who does demand<br>
            that an oath to him be swore<br>
            <br>
            the patriarch<br>
            and the provider<br>
            our warlord king<br>
            who does preside here<br>
            <br>
            mars who plays pretend<br>
            to a platonic form<br>
            but who is created<br>
            as we offer up our norms<br>
            <br>
            only a god in so far<br>
            as he's got us believing<br>
            there's one way to appear<br>
            to be seen as achieving<br>
            <br>
            his power is made<br>
            in the social domain<br>
            as we tithe to him<br>
            our care and our pain<br>
            <br>
            men enter to his congregation<br>
            with selfish acts of mutilation<br>
            of those who kneel, and those who resist<br>
            we break on the wheel, or simply desist<br>
            <br>
            this old man has had his time<br>
            and now his time is done<br>
            he's ours to grant or to decline<br>
            to make into someone<br>
