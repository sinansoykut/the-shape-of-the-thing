         <p>
            you were born a human person<br>
            naive to the world<br>
            ignorant of just exactly<br>
            where you had been hurled<br>
            <br>
            eyes open to your parents<br>
            eyes open to your peers<br>
            taught difference between boys and girls<br>
            with so many jeers<br>
            <br>
            be a big boy<br>
            showing strength and ability<br>
            abandon care<br>
            and with it fragility<br>
            <br>
            don't act like a girl<br>
            you'll be called a slur<br>
            what could be worse<br>
            than an effete poseur<br>
            <br>
            the whispers and the yelling<br>
            the pressures that you face<br>
            abide or be derided<br>
            in here there is no grace<br>
            <br>
            the ways and means your dad was taught<br>
            is what he passed to you<br>
            the gaze and dreams that you have bought<br>
            is what you're teaching too<br>
            <br>
            one is not born a man<br>
            for the men here are made<br>
            not here as we began<br>
            but how we have been played<br>
