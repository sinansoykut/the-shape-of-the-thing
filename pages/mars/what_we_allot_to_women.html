         <p>
            the times they are a changing<br>
            as women change their lot<br>
            and with much rearranging<br>
            some freedoms have been wrought<br>
            <br>
            what we permit to women<br>
            we make shameful to men<br>
            if you will embody these<br>
            you'll be judged feminine<br>
            <br>
            women are our nurturers<br>
            this is what we expect<br>
            to provide us care and comfort<br>
            and to genuflect<br>
            <br>
            have empathy and deference<br>
            is what they are told<br>
            be the bigger person<br>
            even when you're getting sold<br>
            <br>
            regarding chastity<br>
            this is a made up standard<br>
            and so women having sex<br>
            does not make them slandered<br>
            <br>
            granted sensitivity<br>
            to show weakness when you're weak<br>
            to be as soft as you feel<br>
            without hearing critique<br>
            <br>
            emotional expression<br>
            to speak the thing your feeling<br>
            though it's cast as weakness<br>
            at least you're not concealing<br>
            <br>
            submission and support<br>
            the roles women are taught<br>
            binary division<br>
            is what creates our gender knot<br>
            <br>
            and so the lines are drawn<br>
            our experiences preordained<br>
            but we each have agency<br>
            so live it unconstrained<br>
