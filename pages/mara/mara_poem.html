            <p>
                the god of desire and deceit<br>
                mara mara mara<br>
                the god of delusion and self-conceit<br>
                who makes and remakes samsara<br>
                <br>
                he sells avoidance and attachment<br>
                to feel good and never bad<br>
                that you feel detachment<br>
                and for yourself are always glad<br>
                <br>
                as a means of worship<br>
                we keep tightly shut our eyes<br>
                reacting to what happens<br>
                without seeing the lies<br>
                <br>
                mara questions what you've got<br>
                and says look over at your neighbour<br>
                that what's right, is to have more<br>
                to be seen and held as greater<br>
                <br>
                his chord is desire and discontentment<br>
                that you shall be insatiable<br>
                to feel primarily resentment<br>
                for what's unobtainable<br>
                <br>
                and so he says protect your peace<br>
                it's good and right and true<br>
                "let your care for others lapse and cease<br>
                what do they care for you?"<br>
                <br>
                uphold yourself in the highest<br>
                as the first and last thing here<br>
                exalt in your bias<br>
                as if self were all that's dear<br>
                <br>
                mara the beguiler<br>
                who shall remain unseen<br>
                for as long as this defiler<br>
                succeeds in his smokescreen<br>
